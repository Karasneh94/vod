            <h2>What is Video on Demand (VoD)?</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                Video on Demand (VoD) is a media distribution system that allows users to access videos without a
                traditional
                video playback device and the constraints of a typical static broadcasting schedule. In the 20th
                century,
                broadcasting in the form of over-the-air programming was the most common form of media distribution. As
                Internet and IPTV technologies continued to develop in the 1990s, consumers began to gravitate towards
                non-traditional modes of content consumption, which culminated in the arrival of VoD on televisions and
                personal computers.

            broadcast television, VoD systems initially required each user to have an Internet connection with
            considerable bandwidth to access each system's content. In 2000, the Fraunhofer Institute IIS[2] developed
            the JPEG2000 codec, which enabled the distribution of movies via Digital Cinema Packages. This technology
            has since expanded its services from feature-film productions to include broadcast television programmes and
            has led to lower bandwidth requirements for VoD applications. Disney, Paramount, Sony, Universal and Warner
            Bros. subsequently launched the Digital Cinema Initiative,[3] in 2002.

            Television VoD systems can stream content, either through a traditional set-top box or through remote
            devices
            such as computers, tablets, and smartphones. VoD users can permanently download content to a device such as
            a
            computer, digital video recorder or a portable media player for continued viewing. The majority of cable and
            telephone company‚Äìbased television providers offer VoD streaming, whereby a user selects a video programme
            that
            begins to play immediately or downloading to a digital video recorder (DVR) rented or purchased from the
            provider, or to a PC or to a portable device for deferred viewing.
        </p>
<br>
        <p>
            Internet television has emerged as an increasingly popular medium of VoD provision. Desktop client
            applications
            such as the Apple iTunes online content store and Smart TV apps such as Amazon Prime Video allow temporary
            rentals and purchases of video entertainment content. Other Internet-based VoD systems provide users with
            access
            to bundles of video entertainment content rather than individual movies and shows. The most common of these
            systems, Netflix, Hulu and Disney+, use a subscription model that requires users to pay a monthly fee for
            access
            to a selection of movies, television shows, and original series. In contrast, YouTube, another
            Internet-based
            VoD system, uses an advertising-funded model in which users can access most of its video content free of
            cost
            but must pay a subscription fee for premium content. Some airlines offer VoD services as in-flight
            entertainment
            to passengers through video screens embedded in seats or externally provided portable media players.
